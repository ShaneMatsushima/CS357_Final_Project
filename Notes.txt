Need to do:
- look into selecting python files to import for the dfa
- create txt and script for reading input tests
- create requirements for project using pipreqs

solutions:
- look into exec() for running soure code from txt file for imports
    - create struct of dfa in txt
    - read txt file
    - allocate variables based on txt file using exec()
    -import allocated variables to main script
    - run with test files

Notes:
- creates dfa variables to use in order to get the text file
- main creates dfa from grabDFA and runs test script on dfa created

Possible Implementations:
- Create UI for input of files used
- graphic aspect of system working...
