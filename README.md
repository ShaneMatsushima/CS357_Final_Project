# CS357_Final_Project
This project was created for CS 357 final project. Given an input file representing a machine (DFA, NFA, PDA, TM) and an input string, determine if the input string is accepted or rejected. 

## Description
The input files, both .txt, are for the dfa and the test cases. See the test case files for examples of how to create a dfa as well as test cases. The output file creates results of the entire test cases if they are accepted or rejected. The accepted states will show the path created in using states and transitions to show how the test case is accepted. 

## Pre-requisites
In order to run the program, please run the following command to install the required libraries ;
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Note: in order to install requirements, terminal must be in working directory and python installed. 

## Running
The program has been formed into an executable for ease of use. This executable can be found in the dist folder. If the executable does not run properly, the following command will start the main program:
```
python main.py
```
